# Project Requirements Specification

## Overview
A modern web application built with Next.js 14, featuring a flexible data storage system that can scale from local development to production databases. The application follows best practices for TypeScript, component architecture, and UI design using shadcn/ui components.

## Core Technical Stack

### Current Implementation
- [x] Next.js 14 with App Router
- [x] TypeScript for type safety
- [x] Tailwind CSS for styling
- [x] Docker development environment
- [x] JSON-based local database (migration-ready)
- [ ] shadcn/ui component library

### Planned Database Evolution
1. Phase 1: JSON File Storage (Current)
   - Local development
   - Easy data inspection
   - No additional services required

2. Phase 2: Production Database
   - Options:
     - Vercel Postgres + Prisma
     - MongoDB + Mongoose
     - Supabase
     - PlanetScale
   - Migration path from JSON storage

## Feature Requirements
