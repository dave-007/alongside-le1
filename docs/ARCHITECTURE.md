# Architecture Decisions

This document outlines the key architectural decisions made for the Next.js presentation platform, explaining the reasoning behind these choices.

## 1. Technology Stack

### Next.js 14 with App Router

**Decision**: Use Next.js 14 with the App Router for the frontend framework.

**Rationale**:
- Server Components provide improved performance and SEO
- Built-in API routes simplify backend development
- File-based routing reduces configuration overhead
- Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR) for optimal caching
- Strong TypeScript support
- Excellent developer experience

### TypeScript

**Decision**: Use TypeScript for all code.

**Rationale**:
- Type safety reduces runtime errors
- Better IDE support and autocompletion
- Self-documenting code
- Easier refactoring
- Improved team collaboration

### Tailwind CSS

**Decision**: Use Tailwind CSS for styling.

**Rationale**:
- Utility-first approach speeds up development
- Consistent design system
- Reduced CSS bundle size with PurgeCSS
- Responsive design made simple
- Easy theming and customization

### shadcn/ui Component Library

**Decision**: Use shadcn/ui for UI components.

**Rationale**:
- High-quality, accessible components
- Consistent design language
- Customizable with Tailwind
- No runtime package dependencies
- Copy-paste approach allows for easy modification

## 2. Data Management

### JSON File Storage (Initial Phase)

**Decision**: Start with JSON file-based storage for development.

**Rationale**:
- Simplifies initial development
- No database setup required
- Easy to inspect and modify data
- Suitable for prototyping
- Straightforward migration path to production databases

### Repository Pattern

**Decision**: Implement a repository pattern for data access.

**Rationale**:
- Abstracts data storage implementation details
- Enables easy switching between storage solutions
- Centralizes data access logic
- Simplifies testing with mock repositories
- Provides consistent API for CRUD operations

### Planned Database Migration

**Decision**: Design for future migration to a production database.

**Rationale**:
- Scalability for production use
- Better performance for larger datasets
- Improved data integrity and reliability
- Support for complex queries
- Concurrent access handling

## 3. API Design

### REST API

**Decision**: Use REST API for backend communication.

**Rationale**:
- Familiar pattern for developers
- Stateless architecture
- Cacheable responses
- Leverages HTTP standards
- Well-supported by Next.js API routes

### Type-Safe API Contracts

**Decision**: Define strict types for API requests and responses.

**Rationale**:
- Ensures consistency between frontend and backend
- Reduces integration errors
- Improves developer experience
- Enables better documentation
- Simplifies testing

## 4. Authentication and Authorization

### Future Implementation

**Decision**: Plan for JWT-based authentication with role-based access control.

**Rationale**:
- Stateless authentication fits well with serverless architecture
- Roles (Presenter, Learner) map well to feature access
- Scalable approach for user management
- Secure by default with proper implementation
- Integrates well with Next.js middleware

## 5. Frontend Architecture

### Component Structure

**Decision**: Organize components by feature and reusability.

**Rationale**:
- Improves code organization
- Facilitates code reuse
- Simplifies maintenance
- Supports team collaboration
- Aligns with domain concepts

### State Management

**Decision**: Use React Context for global state with local component state where appropriate.

**Rationale**:
- Avoids unnecessary complexity of external state libraries
- Built into React
- Sufficient for most application needs
- Easy to understand and maintain
- Can be extended with useReducer for complex state

## 6. Performance Considerations

### Server Components

**Decision**: Leverage Next.js Server Components for data-heavy pages.

**Rationale**:
- Reduces client-side JavaScript
- Improves initial page load
- Better SEO
- Simplified data fetching
- Improved performance for content-heavy pages

### Static Generation with ISR

**Decision**: Use Static Generation with Incremental Static Regeneration for presentation listings.

**Rationale**:
- Fastest possible page loads
- Reduced server load
- Good for SEO
- Content updates without full rebuilds
- Cost-effective hosting

## 7. Deployment Strategy

### Containerized Deployment

**Decision**: Deploy as containerized application on Ubuntu 24.04.

**Rationale**:
- Consistent environment across development and production
- Simplified dependency management
- Scalable deployment options
- Easier CI/CD integration
- Portable across hosting providers

## 8. Monitoring and Logging

### Planned Implementation

**Decision**: Implement structured logging and monitoring.

**Rationale**:
- Enables proactive issue detection
- Provides insights into application usage
- Helps identify performance bottlenecks
- Supports troubleshooting
- Improves overall reliability

## 9. Testing Strategy

### Multi-Level Testing

**Decision**: Implement unit, integration, and end-to-end testing.

**Rationale**:
- Ensures code quality at multiple levels
- Catches different types of issues
- Provides confidence in changes
- Supports refactoring
- Documents expected behavior

## Future Considerations

1. **Real-time Features**: Evaluate WebSockets or Server-Sent Events for notifications
2. **Internationalization**: Plan for multi-language support
3. **Accessibility**: Ensure WCAG compliance throughout the application
4. **Mobile App**: Consider React Native for mobile applications
5. **Analytics**: Implement user behavior tracking for feature optimization
